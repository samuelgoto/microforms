# Affordances

Microforms comes with built-in hypermedia affordances to enable the programatic execution of API calls.

By design, we start by re-using as many existing hypertext affordances from the well established HTML set. We extend new attributes and elements when necessary and remove attributes whenever they are not applicable to machine-readable clients.

Here is the set of elements available in microforms:

* [doc](doc.html)
* [link](link.html)
* [label](label.html)
* [form](form.html)
    * [input](input.html)
    * [fieldset](fieldset.html)
